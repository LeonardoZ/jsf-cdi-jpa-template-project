# JSF CDI JPA Template Project for Servlet Containers

This is a simples template for JSF (2.2), JPA (2.1), CDI (1.0), made to be used with Tomcat. It is configured to use MySQL and HikariCP, but you can easily change to another RDBMS system, just altering the dependencies in *pom.xml* and the configs in *src/main/resources/persistence.xml*. Use as you like.
